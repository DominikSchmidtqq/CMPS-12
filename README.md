# CMPS-12B

## Lab 1
* Tracery (tracery.io) is a simple text-expansion langauge, running about 7000 chatbots on Twitter
* This assignment implements a simplified version of Tracery to recursively generate generative text

## Assignment 1
* This assignment implements Merge Sort and Binary Search to count the number of times certain words occur in Mary Shelley's novel "Frankenstein" and compares the efficiency of different algorithms

## Assignment 2
* This assignment implements a linked list to store groups of rhyming words read in from a pronunciation dictionary.  Given a pair of words, use this data structure to determine if two words rhyme. 

## Lab 2
* Weâ€™re coming back to Tracery (Lab 1) with this assignment but instead of always reading the grammar from a file and writing the expanded grammar to the command line, we will also be able to read a grammar from the command line and write the expanded grammar to a file.
